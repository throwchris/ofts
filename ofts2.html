    <p class="w3-justify">If we confess and recognize our sin, he says, “If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” </p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Isaiah 1:18</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;</strong> All sin is 
        forgiven at salvation and thereafter, if confessed, while we walk in that realm.  Now look, we are in the grace realm here, just the grace of being saved, Amen.  The church is obedience 
        to faith.  Now the kingdom is obedience to the Spirit.  Do you understand?  Am I getting it clear?  The church order is obedience to faith, the faith of Christ.  But the kingdom is 
        obedient to the Spirit.  We are not led anymore just by sight and by what we hear around and by preaching and so on and so forth.  But when we come into the kingdom realm, then we have 
        to be led absolutely by the Spirit in everything in life.  We are Sons of God.  We have to walk after the Spirit.  "For as many as are led by the Spirit are the Sons of God", and Sons 
        also of the kingdom of heaven, which is the same thing.  This is a new relationship for this hour.</p>
  

    <p class="w3-justify">Now, we have heard these scriptures over and over until they do not mean anything to us.  We do not know what they are saying. But the Lord let me see today what he 
        was saying.  For as many as are led, I mean led, by the Spirit, really led by the Spirit, continually in everything that we do, we have to be led by the Spirit. Now as we get on in the 
        message, you are going to see how important this is and how we cannot come into the kingdom unless we are strictly led by the Spirit.  This is a new revelation for this hour to bring 
        forth perfected Sons for his glory.</p>

    
    <p class="w3-justify">We do not know the way.  The only thing we know is the Spirit, and the Spirit knows the way.  We do not know the way to perfection, but the Spirit knows the way to 
        perfection and he knows how to bring these Sons to glory.  God will deal with each one of us differently than with the church in general.  Every Son is going to be dealt with 
        differently than the old church order.  Now since many of us have come out of church order, don’t you see that there is a new life, a new walk, a new way that we are being led even 
        though we do not understand it all.  We do not know it all, but yet we know that it is something different.  It is entirely different.  You go back into the old church order, you will 
        find out you are unhappy there.  There is just something that is not right.  We are used to the freedom of the Spirit and to see the manifestations of the Spirit and to feel the life 
        of the Spirit.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">He disciples us as a Father with his Son so we might inherit his kingdom as did Jesus.  Now the same way that he disciples us, he discipled Jesus the same way, that 
        he might know the Father.  So Christ is our example. Amen.  Christ had to know the Spirit, and he had to follow the Spirit even into the wilderness after he received the baptism; and 
        be willing to be led of the Spirit right into the wilderness to be tempted, that he might learn to know God, the Father; that he might learn to know the voice of the Father.  And we 
        have to do exactly the same thing.  We have to follow the Spirit wherever the Spirit leads if we expect to inherit the kingdom with Christ.  Our relationship to God has to be exactly 
        on the same basis as Christ’s relationship was to the Father.  Now if he is our example, if he is our elder brother and if we are going to inherit everything with him, and he was a 
        flesh man like we are flesh people, and if God is leading us into the fullness the same as he led Christ into the fullness, then we have to follow his pattern by the Spirit.  He 
        followed the Spirit.  Now we cannot look at Jesus Christ and read about him and try to follow in his steps.  That is a lot of baloney.  I am talking about the Spirit.  We have to 
        follow the same Spirit that led Jesus Christ when he was baptized in the water and the Spirit come upon him that took him into the wilderness.  And we have to be led by that same 
        Spirit and give ourselves completely, unreservedly, to the Spirit of God, who is the only one that knows how to lead us on in to that place.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.4</p>    
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Philippians 3:12-20</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Not as though I had already attained, either were already 
        perfect: but I follow after,</strong> The Spirit.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ Jesus. Brethren, I count not 
        myself to have attained, or apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press toward the 
        mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal 
        even this unto you. Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained,</strong> As far as we have gone.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the 
        same thing. Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as ye have us for an ensample. (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even 
        weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ: Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly 
        things.)</strong> Do you see what he says?  There are those that are attaining just to earthly things, not following the Spirit, just earthly things.
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For our conversation is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> Which is the Spirit.  Now we have been 
        apprehended by God, now it just says that we have been apprehended by God to grow up into the fullness of Christ.  That is what our calling is for.</p>    
  

    <p class="w3-justify">What the Spirit wants us to know, that we need to have an understanding of the scriptures and that is the difference between the church world and the Sons.  There is 
        a straight line from scripture to scripture, all through the scriptures. He is bringing us into this relationship with him now.  This is the most cautious time in my whole lifetime of 
        serving God to where I have to be very careful of the scriptures, that I don’t misinterpret the scriptures and I have to follow the Spirit very closely in everything that I teach, to 
        make sure that everything is of him.  Amen.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Romans 8:14</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</strong> In 
        other words, if we are not led by the Spirit, we are not Sons of God.  We are just children of God out here, playing in the marketplace.  Amen.  Right?  Now do you understand that 
        scripture a little better?  About the children.  Amen.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">John 16:13</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> Howbeit when he,</strong> Now this was before the Holy Ghost had come into the 
        people.<strong class="w3-text-red"> the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth:</strong> This is a different relationship than grace through faith.  There were many 
        that had been saved up to this time, but Jesus was telling them, “Howbeit when he, the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth.”  So we have that promise when we 
        receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost, and there are many that will be filled with the Holy Ghost and will be overcomers, but they will not be ruling and reigning with Christ.  I found 
        that out today in the scriptures.  There are many Holy Ghost filled people in the churches.  They won’t be overcomers, but that is a different realm again.  But the called out Sons are 
        called to rule and reign with Christ.  There is a different relationship than grace through faith, but perfect obedience to the Spirit within.  This is what the Sons of God must walk 
        in: perfect obedience to the Spirit, not just halfway.  Many overcomers, as I say, will walk in the Spirit, but they will never grow into perfection into that, “Be ye perfect even as 
        your Father in heaven is perfect.”  Those are the ones that are coming in, the called out chosen ones of God, Amen, called to be Sons.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.5</p>
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">John 15:10</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my 
        Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</strong> Now no man that I know of up to this time has kept every commandment of the Father like Jesus did.  But he is giving us a secret 
        here, or a recipe, of what the Sons of God will be.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">John 15:10-12</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my 
        Father's commandments, and abide in his love.</strong> We will not come into this place of abiding into his perfect love until we are purged from the flesh and the flesh desires.  Now 
        the Spirit will direct us into that.<strong class="w3-text-red"> These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.</strong> Now no 
        one has attained unto the fullness of the joy yet.  But Jesus dropped these good little nuggets here and there so that we would have an understanding as Sons, and it is just now being 
        revealed in the last few years.  And I say such revelation in the last few months that is going everywhere, not just for this little group, but everywhere you are hearing of revelation 
        coming forth concerning these things.<strong class="w3-text-red"> This is my commandment,</strong> Jesus says, not the commandment of the Father under the law.  Do you see what he is 
        saying?  This is the new commandment that you love one another.  Remember when he said, “I give unto thee a new commandment?”  So, we can’t hook this up with the law or grace.  This is 
        the commandment of Sons, for the Sons.  This is Jesus’ commandment.<strong class="w3-text-red"> And this is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.</strong> 
        Moses’ law was not what Jesus was following, but he followed the Spirit of God the Father because he was the Son, the first fruits, Amen, the first Son.</p>
        
    
    <p class="w3-justify">John 15:15-17<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"></strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his 
        lord doeth:</strong> Now I know I walked in this realm.  I only believed what I heard, what some preacher told me, and I was as happy as I could be.  I was like a little child just 
        tickled to death of my salvation.  Praise God for that realm.  But my, I didn’t want to stay there.  I don’t want to stay where I am now.  I want to finish this race.  
        Amen.<strong class="w3-text-red"> Henceforth I call you not servants;</strong> Now the Sons are not servants.  You remember?  He said, “Even though they’re under governors and tutors, 
        but someday, they will become full heirs.<strong class="w3-text-red"> for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard 
        of my Father I have made known unto you.</strong> Now that hasn’t happened yet, has it?  We do not know all things.  Amen.  But it is coming.<strong class="w3-text-red"> Ye have not 
        chosen me,</strong> We had no choice in this. We had no choice to be called into this realm.<strong class="w3-text-red"> but I have  chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and 
        bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.</strong> It is coming.  We have not attained, or neither 
        has anyone else attained, that anything that we ask for, the Father will do, because we would ask out of the flesh.  But when we get a full knowledge of him like he has promised, then 
        we will walk in the Spirit like Christ did.<strong class="w3-text-red"> These things I command you, that ye love one another.</strong> Now the Lord said today, “The law of the Spirit is 
        much more strenuous than Moses’ law.”  You think they had an easy time?  That was the hard way they kept the law.  “But the law of the Spirit is much harder, much more strenuous,” the 
        Lord says.  We are going to find that out as we keep walking with the Lord.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Matthew 5:27-28</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit 
        adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust</strong> He says, “I say, I say.”  Here is Jesus’ commandment again to bring in Sons.  This is the walk of Sons.  
        Remember now, we are talking about Sons here.<strong class="w3-text-red"> But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her 
        already in his heart.</strong> Because this Spirit that we are supposed to be following would never lead you into lust.  It would lead you into purity and perfection.  We are not 
        following the Spirit if we are looking after these things that way.  Amen.</p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Matthew 5:38-40</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> Ye have heard that it hath been said,</strong> Under the law.
        <strong class="w3-text-red"> An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth: But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the 
        other also.</strong> Jesus is bringing us to the place where we could stand like he did and have our beards pulled out, to be slapped in the face, to be spit upon.  That is the work of 
        the Spirit to bring this soul under subjection to God.  He does not do that to punish you.  Amen.  But it is to break the will of the flesh, that we can be subject to God and to the 
        Spirit of God, which Jesus had to go through, that the flesh would become nothing, that it would be willing; that he could even lay down his life if need be for the Spirit, by the 
        Spirit.<strong class="w3-text-red"> And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy cloke also.</strong> This is going to be some people, isn’t it?</p>
        
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.6</p>
    
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Matthew 5:43-44</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate 
        thine enemy. But I say</strong> The commandment of Christ.<strong class="w3-text-red"> unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray 
        for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you;</strong> Now here is for the Sons.  So was this other.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-light-blue">Matthew 5:48</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.
        </strong> We are coming to a place where we cannot even have the privilege of having an evil thought.  I saw something when he said this.  Now you can go to your pastors, you can go to 
        your own natural fathers, to anyone in a normal church, just a church, and they will laugh at you.  They will say, “That was just for Christ;  no man can attain to it,” because they 
        won’t understand the law of the Spirit.  Amen.  But it is the Word.  When it comes right down to it, you cannot deny in verse 48 when he says, “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your 
        Father which is in heaven is perfect.”  Now we know we cannot attain that after the flesh without the Spirit, but as we follow the Spirit.  We cannot come into this in the law of grace 
        or under the law of Moses; it could not be done.  But it can be attained by the law of the Spirit.  Only by the Spirit that dwells in us, as we let him have his way, can we ever attain 
        unto this perfection, attain unto the fullness of the Sons of God.  And as a Son, God requires the same from us as he did his Son, Jesus.</p>    


    <p class="w3-justify">Do you think he is going to send his Son here and put him through this hell on earth and require any less of us?  No.  No way.  We must assume this responsibility.  
        This is one reason why I said tonight, “Boy, if you do not want to go on, you had better not hear the message.”  Because we answer for what we hear, and if we say that we have committed 
        ourselves to the call of Sons of God and do not walk up to the light that we have</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">Suppose we have accepted this call and relationship to the Father.  Most of us here have been willing to accept it and we make bold remarks about how we would give our 
        life, and so on and so forth, for Christ.  We have to.  Amen.  I do not mean a physical death.  Some of us may have to.  Paul had to, but I am going to speak on that later.  What 
        happens if we turn away and follow the command or wishes of our parents, relatives, pastors, husbands and wives, or children and so forth?  What does the scripture say will happen to 
        us?</p>
