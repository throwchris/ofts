    <p class="w3-justify">If we disobey the Spirit that calls us to do something, or to commit our lives, and we listen to anyone but the Spirit; we have to be totally committed to the Spirit.  
        We are not debtors to the flesh.  Have you read that scripture?  We are not debtors to the flesh.  We are debtors to the Spirit.  We are not debtors to any flesh.  Do you hear 
        that? I don’t care if it is your mother, your father.  Jesus says, “Who is my mother and my father?”  Remember?  And so on and so forth, “And my brothers and sisters, but him that 
        doeth the will of the Father.  They’re my brothers and sisters.”  So we cannot come in to be brethren of Christ (and he calls us brethren); he said he was not ashamed to call us 
        brethren; and we cannot become brothers of Christ unless we become followers of God just like he did.  There are too many scriptures on it.  We are just kidding ourselves if we think 
        we are going to get by any other way.</p>

    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Mark 10:28-30</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Then Peter began to say unto him, Lo, we have left all, and have followed 
        thee. And Jesus answered and said,</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, 
        or wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, and the gospel's,</strong> Now you would think that he would say, “Stick to your family,” wouldn’t you?  You would not expect this 
        out of the Lord.<strong class="w3-text-red"> But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with 
        persecutions;</strong> He threw it right in there with them, didn’t he?<strong class="w3-text-red"> and in the world to come eternal life.</strong> Now here is what Jesus thinks of 
        us.</p>
            
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Luke 9:62</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> And Jesus said unto him,</strong><strong class="w3-text-red"> No man, having put his 
        hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom</strong> The kingdom.  Amen.  The kingdom.<strong class="w3-text-red"> of God.</strong> Now that is pretty plain.  If we 
        start out for the kingdom and we just decide we are going to quit, I want to tell you, there is something that is going to happen to these quitters and I am going to get to that pretty 
        soon.  We are either going all of the way once we start in this kingdom realm, or we are in deep, deep trouble.  Is there an antidote for us who have failed to obey the Spirit and our 
        commitment?  Is there any way out?  Is there any way out, whatsoever?  Now, we found the way out, that antidote for the grace in the children.  See, we found that out.  It is the blood 
        of Christ and the mercy and, “O Lord, forgive me,” and then they go on the street and play some more.  And they are in that realm, but they will never attain unto the kingdom.  God is 
        looking for an army that will absolutely obey his command to follow the Spirit, to follow God.  And he is going to have one.  He is going to have this army.  Amen.  And we will come 
        under full command of the Spirit, absolutely obedient, absolutely obedient.  We cannot vary in one point, not one point, or we are not fit for the kingdom.  I said, “Is it grace 
        through faith and by confession?” No. Now I want you to get these scriptures because they are very, very important.</p>

        those who were once enlightened,</strong> Now look, there is a difference in being saved and being enlightened.  Amen.  There is a difference in having your sins forgiven and going out 
        and committing sin and having the grace and the blood of Christ continually cover your sins in that realm than it is to be called by the Spirit, Sons of God.
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, And have 
        tasted the good word</strong> Which is Christ.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> of God, and the powers of the world to come,</strong> Some of us have tasted these powers, haven’t we?  
        Amen.  We have felt the powers of God in unusual manifestations of the Spirit.  Now that is what he is talking about.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> If they shall fall 
        away,</strong> These that have come into these places such as we have.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son 
        of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</strong></p>
        
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Hebrews 10:26-27</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For if we sin wilfully</strong> Willfully.
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> after that we have received the knowledge of the truth,</strong> Remember he said the truth.  This is what it is all about.
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour the 
        adversaries.</strong> And what are the adversaries?  Self-will, lust, carnality, flesh.  No more grace.  No more mercy.  No forgiveness.  Is that what the Word just said?  Seeing we 
        crucify Christ afresh.  Now there is some hope for us.  Do not give up.  But I want to tell you something.  I do not want the way that the Bible says we are going to get by with, 
        because it is a fearful thing.  It is fearful once you are called to the high calling of God and do not accept it and take your own way.</p>    


    <p class="w3-justify">If we can understand that this is God’s Word, and this is what we are going to be judged by.  This is the very word that we will be judged by, right here.  And if you 
        know that you are called to the high calling of God – and I do not think you would be here unless you were called to the high calling of God.  I mean it.</p>

    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.9</p>    

    
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Hebrews 12:6-11</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every</strong> 
        Who?<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> son whom he receiveth.</strong> If you want to be a Son, just remember, you are going to get whipped and chastened because he says he 
        “chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receives.” Now I know that he has received me as a Son of God.  I know this, and I know that I have been chastened time and time again 
        severely through the years, and it just draws me closer to him because I know he is doing the work that he said he was going to do in me; and I know that I can come in no other way 
        because I am a no good flesh person with an evil heart.  And this has to be done away with by my subjection to God by the Spirit.  This is why I like to lay out in front of him and 
        say, “Lay it on, Lord.  Get rid of it.  Get rid of it.  Just get rid of this flesh.”  Because if you know you have to go through the fire, it is better to just go through it.  Ask him 
        to put you through it.  Why prolong the ordeal by sliding around, Amen, and trying to play games with the Spirit?<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> If ye endure chastening, God 
        dealeth with you as with sons;</strong> If ye endure chastening.  But now you can back out, but woe be unto you if you do.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> If ye endure chastening, 
        God dealeth with you as with sons; for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?</strong></p>    


    
    <p class="w3-justify">I have to keep referring you back to the two orders of God.  The orders of grace and forgiveness and faith to past that, into the order of being led by the Spirit.  
        They are the Sons of God.  They are the Sons of God.  And there is no other way we can come in, but by the order that God has ordained.  It is not my order.  This is the order that the 
        scripture says that we have to go by.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers,</strong> All the Sons.
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> then are ye bastards, and not sons.</strong> You do not have a father.  That is what a bastard is.  You just do not have a father.  Amen.
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection unto the 
        Father of spirits, and live?</strong> He is the Father of spirits that will lead us into this complete Spirit life led by the Spirit and you cannot get in there any other way but by a 
        knowledge of Jesus Christ through the Spirit, by the Word, through the Word.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For they verily for a few days</strong> These natural fathers.
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> chastened us after their own pleasure; but he</strong> God.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> for our profit, that we might be partakers of his 
        holiness.</strong> Do you see why we have to be chastised?  That we might become holy like he is holy.  Amen.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> Now no chastening for the present 
        seemeth to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised</strong> Or trained
        <strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> thereby.</strong> We are trained by chastisement.  This is the way we are trained in the Spirit, as the Spirit leads us into chastisement that we 
        might be perfected and learn how to follow the Spirit.  So our relationship as Sons is different from that of children or church realm, entirely different.  I will guarantee you because 
        I tried it, that if you go back into the church realm, you will just, well, you will just dry up.  You will lose all your desire even, if you stay there, to even become a Son.  You will 
        lose your desire to ever go on to be kings and priests unto God.  And first thing you know, the things that were taught to you, will become like nothing and you won’t even have faith in 
        him anymore and you will just go on back and you will be back in that realm, but watch out.  There is something coming for you if you are called to be Sons and you have made that 
        commitment and have not kept it because the scriptures show us that.</p> 
        
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-light-gray" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.10</p>    
    

    <p class="w3-justify">It says, “What is the antidote?  Though we cry,” now here, if we turn back, he says, “Though we cry in despair and repentance,” though we should, if we turn back, 
        “And we cry to God with all of our hearts saying, ‘God forgive me, God forgive me,’ there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin.”  If you do not believe it, go back and read Hebrews 
        6:4-6. Even though you cry for repentance.</p>
        
    
    <p class="w3-justify"><strong class="w3-text-red">Hebrews 6:4-6</strong><strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the 
        heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto 
        repentance;</strong> Because there is no repentance.<strong class="w3-text-light-blue"> seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</strong></p>    
  

    <p class="w3-justify">His grace does not come down to remove it.  He does not come down to remove that sin, but he says, “You just look for the judgment of God,” which we read in Hebrews, 
        the 10th chapter.  There is nothing but chastisement that can come to you after that, but we are still afflicted.  As you go from place to place (and I have seen people that go from 
        place to place to place), looking for a deliverance, looking for deliverance.  They go and they have had a thousand preachers lay hands on them, maybe, and they go away full of despair 
        with no deliverance because they are trying to find it through repentance and there is a Word that tells you how, that we have never been taught.</p>


    <p class="w3-justify">You cannot find, once you break away from God, once you have been called to the walk of the Spirit and chosen of God to be a Son of God and you go away and do not 
        fulfill the call – this is the thing; it is disobedience; that is the sin – once this happens to us, to ever go back to repentance, you cannot repent your way back in.  He says there 
        remaineth no repentance.  There is none, Amen, but the fearful, looking for the judgment of God.  They are still afflicted and live in despair and I have watched it.  The antidote for 
        the church people does not work anymore.  It just does not work.  The antidote is not the same, but chastisement and judgment.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">But the children, can go ahead and get healed after they confess and go on as before because that is the order.  That is the realm they are in.  I know.  I have been 
        there.  Man, I would get up to the altar when I would do something wrong or say something wrong and I would just cry and say, “God forgive me. God forgive me.”  And man, he would just 
        lift my spirit and I would just know, “Oh, thank you, Lord,” and I could just feel all cleansed and good.  But you try it now.  You are going to find out it is a lot different.  You 
        have to go back to that commitment.  But Sons of God will be chastened until obedience is learned by the things that he suffers.  That is scripture.  Amen.</p> 
        
       
  

    <p class="w3-justify">And I have seen Sons of God that were called to be Sons, leave the ministry and fall under afflictions because they would not walk after the Spirit.  Now God promised 
        that he would not put more on us than we are able to bear, Amen, but it is going to cost you something: never to return.  Though chastened by God until they again come into obedience.  
        They have to go right back to that place where they left off obedience.  God has not changed one bit from how he was to the children of Israel.  Go back to that place of commitment that 
        you made to him.</p>
    
    <p class="w3-right-align w3-text-orange" style="opacity: 0.5">pp.11</p> 

    <p class="w3-justify">But they are never the same.  They seem to always be under affliction of some sort until they go by death; either absolute death to the flesh in natural death or 
        absolute death to the flesh to all desires.  Amen, but it will never be the same.  I have watched them come and go through many years, those that had the high calling on their lives.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">I did not just start teaching this message yesterday; I have known the Son of God message for at least twenty years, that I have watched those that were called Sons 
        of God.  I have known for at least twenty years that I was called to be a Son of God.  We have taught this message for years, but not the same.  I did not see the difference until 
        today.  How God has the grace for the children and the chastisement for the Sons, without forgiveness, because you are a chosen vessel of the Lord and have failed to keep your vow, or 
        commitment to the Father.  When you make a commitment to the Father, he takes you at your word.  He takes you at your word.  He says it is better to have never made a vow than to make 
        a vow and break it.  We can be healed, but we will never be restored, because he says so.  We will never be fully restored, but we can be healed if we go back and do the work</p>   
  

    <p class="w3-justify">I have watched some preachers; this is what I am on because I am a preacher and I feel like I have to pick on myself first, Amen.  Once they are called into this high 
        calling, and if they do not go back, maybe they have gone to tending a bar, or grocery clerk, or whatever, but they are miserable.  I have watched at least a dozen of them that I know 
        personally, that this has happened to.  They say, "I am going to quit the ministry.  It is too hard."  Things are going rough because there is a little chastisement coming against them, 
        and a little fire.  It would get a little hot, so they quit.  So they have gone to selling insurance; one sold insurance; another man bought a grocery store.  I know all kinds of them.  
        But there was nothing but trouble.  God did not bless them in anything that happened.  They were nothing but under bondage and fear.  I know of a couple that tried to come back and went 
        into the ministry.  And I only know of one, (and I am not too sure of him because I have lost track of him,) but about ten years ago one of them that I know actually made a try at 
        coming back.  And his ministry was not the same, but he was trying to really make a dedication to God again.</p>


    <p class="w3-justify">But remember this judgment of God.  This is the Word of God and it has to come to pass.  But the chastening hand of the Lord will be lifted if we go back and do what 
        we were first told to do.  But it is just like a child. You might chasten that child, and he might come to the place where he is obedient, but you are always going to keep an eye on him 
        because you have lost some trust in him.  Amen.  But we cannot come back by repentance.  I want you to know that.  If you break away from God once you have made that commitment, you are 
        going to be under chastisement of God.</p>   
    

    <p class="w3-justify">For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, And have tasted the good 
        word of God, and the powers of the world to come, If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to 
        an open shame.</p>
